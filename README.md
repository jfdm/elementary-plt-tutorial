# A tutorial on Formal Methods

This tutorial will provide an introduction to some elementary topics in programming language theory.
We will do this through construction of interpreters for two simple programming languages: Arith Lang, and the well-typed lambda calculus.
The dependently typed programming language `Idris` will be used to introduce these concepts.

The arith-lang was orginally described formally in a blog post entitled /Crash Course on Notation in Programming Language Theory./ Here we present the formalisations together with an interpreter written in `Idris`.

The interpreter for the well-typed lambda calculus was originally presented in the tutorial for the Idris language. Here we present the interpreter with some additional material explaining the underlying formal methods.

More information over Idris can be found online at: [http://www.idris-lang.org]
